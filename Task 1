# Sample data for gender distribution
gender <- c("Male", "Female")
count <- c(45, 55)

# Creating the bar chart
barplot(count, names.arg=gender, col=c("blue", "pink"), 
        xlab="Gender", ylab="Count", main="Gender Distribution")




Histogram for Age Distribution
Here's the R code to create a histogram for age distribution:

r code
# Sample data for age distribution
ages <- c(22, 25, 30, 35, 28, 40, 22, 27, 29, 33, 31, 26, 38, 45, 21, 36, 39, 23, 34, 37, 41, 32, 30, 24, 29)

# Creating the histogram
hist(ages, breaks=10, col="green", border="black", 
     xlab="Age", ylab="Frequency", 
     main="Age Distribution")
